# Segmentation of Neuron Bundles from Diffusion MRI

## Project Description
Project for Statistical Learning Theory Course at ETH Zurich by Antonio Orvieto, Moisés Torres García and Sjoerd van Bekhoven.

## Repository Structure
* code/
  * data/ 
* literature/
  * papers/
* report/

## Pre-processing
You can either do the pre-processing yourself, or download the following two files and place them in "code/data":
* embeddings (download at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-BbrQ1IXzeqa2drbkQyaTBjZ0E)
* FA (download at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-BbrQ1IXzeqSmpZek1jT1RWZVU)

If you want to do the pre-processing yourself, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the following files are present in the folder "code/data/":
  * embeddings
  * diff_data.nii.gz
2. Add the "NIfTI" MATLAB library to your path (http://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image)
3. Check if all paths are correctly for your system and run all sections in "code/preprocessing/main.m".
4. Place the files "embeddings" and "FA" generated by the file in the folder "code/data/".

## Instructions
1. Make sure that in the folder "code/data/" the following files are present:
  * embeddings
  * diff_data.nii.gz
